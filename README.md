## Saidolimkhon Akmalov
Currently a full-time student at Regents University. I am a very ambitious, energetic and hard working person. Therefore, I will not leave a problem unsolved unless it will be unsolvable. I love how the financial world is developing through tech. I really want to get into fintech and learn more about it.


## Skills
**Adaptable** - It's easy for me to be working in new enviroments with different people of different ages and abilities. I have worked in a bank before and there it is imperative to have this skill.

**Creative** - I am always able to find creative solutions to any problem. Being creative for me is like second nature. For example when coding I love to be creative as there is never one solution to a problem.

**Team-player** - I am always down to get my hands dirty if the team will require me to, and will always be happy to offer my help for any internal problems, which may arise in the team.

**Diterminant** - I never leave a problem undone, even if would take me a whole day of sit down coding. I will also help anyone in need until they will understand the information more clearly.
